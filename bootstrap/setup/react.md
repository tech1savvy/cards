Why does importing Bootstrap's JavaScript in `src/main.jsx` fail while it works correctly in `src/App.jsx`?

---

This is a timing issue related to DOM rendering in React.

- When imported in `src/main.jsx`, the Bootstrap JS executes *before* React renders the application's components to the DOM.
- Bootstrap's JavaScript needs to attach event listeners to specific DOM elements (e.g., those with `data-bs-toggle`). If these elements don't exist yet, the setup fails.
- When imported in `src/App.jsx`, the component and its children are being rendered, so the necessary DOM elements are available for Bootstrap's JavaScript to initialize correctly.

---

In short, for Bootstrap's JavaScript to function, the HTML elements it needs to interact with must already exist in the DOM. Importing it within a component like `App.jsx` rather than at the entry point (`main.jsx`) ensures the DOM is ready.
