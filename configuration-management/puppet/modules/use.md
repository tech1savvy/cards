What are the benefits of using Puppet modules?

---

- **Reusability**: Write once, use on multiple nodes.
- **Organization**: Keep related configurations together.
- **Sharing**: Puppet Forge allows you to use community modules.

---

- A module called `apache` can install Apache, start the service, and deploy a website file.
