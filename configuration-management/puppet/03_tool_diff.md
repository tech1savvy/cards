### **`Puppet vs Ansible`**

> Both are Configuration Management tools used to automate server setup and software deployment.
> 

| Feature | **Puppet** | **Ansible** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language | **DSL** (Puppet-specific language) | **YAML** (easy to read & write) |
| Architecture | **Agent-based** (Puppet agent) | **Agentless** (uses SSH) |
| Ease of Use | More complex | Simpler, beginner-friendly |
| Execution Mode | Pull-based (clients pull configs) | Push-based (server pushes configs) |
| Setup | Requires master-agent infra | Simple setup (just SSH needed) |
| Use Case | Large, complex environments | Quick automation, flexible usage |

✅ **Ansible** is more flexible and easier to start with

✅ **Puppet** is more suitable for **enterprise-scale, complex** infra

### **`Terraform vs AWS CloudFormation`**

> Both are Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools used for provisioning cloud infrastructure.
> 

| Feature | **Terraform** | **CloudFormation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud Support | **Multi-cloud** (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) | Only **AWS** |
| Language | **HCL** (HashiCorp Configuration Lang) | **JSON/YAML** |
| State Management | External **state file** | Managed internally by AWS |
| Modularity | Better support for **modules & reuse** | Modular support exists, but less clean |
| Community Support | Very large (open-source, many modules) | Strong AWS integration |
| Speed/Flexibility | Faster development, flexible | Slower, tightly coupled with AWS |

✅ **Terraform** for multi-cloud or advanced provisioning

✅ **CloudFormation** for **deep AWS integration & native features**

### **`Nagios vs Splunk`**

> Both are Monitoring and Logging tools, but they serve different purposes.
> 

| Feature | **Nagios** | **Splunk** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose | **Monitoring & alerting** | **Log management & analysis** |
| Setup Complexity | Manual & config-file based | GUI-based, easier once integrated |
| Data Type | Checks service health/status | Stores & queries **logs** & metrics |
| Visualization | Basic graphs | Rich dashboards & search features |
| Alerting | Yes, with plugins and scripts | Yes, integrated |
| Scalability | Limited without plugins/add-ons | Highly scalable |
| Cost | Free version available (Nagios Core) | **Expensive** (per GB of ingested data) |

✅ **Nagios** for **infrastructure/service monitoring**

✅ **Splunk** for **log analysis, incident response, and big data** analytics
