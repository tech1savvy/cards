What are URLs in Django and what is their purpose?

---

URLs in Django are patterns that route web requests to specific views. They define the structure of your website and map URL paths to Python view functions or classes.

---

- URLs act as the entry point to your web application
- They connect user requests to the appropriate view functions
- URLs can be static (fixed paths) or dynamic (with changing parameters)
- They are defined in `urls.py` files using the `path()` function
- URLs help organize and structure your web application's navigation
