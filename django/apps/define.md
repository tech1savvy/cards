What are django apps? How they are different form django project?

---

- Django apps are self-contained, modular components or packages within a Django project that encapsulate a specific functionality or feature.
- For example, an app could handle user authentication, blog posts, a product catalog, or payments.

---

- An app typically contains its own models, views, templates, URL configurations, static files, and tests.
- This modular design helps in organizing, maintaining, and scaling the codebase efficiently.
