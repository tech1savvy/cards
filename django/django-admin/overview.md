What is Django Admin and how do you access and use it?

---

Django Admin is a built-in, automatic web-based interface for managing your application's data through your models.

### What is Django Admin?
- A powerful, automatic admin interface that reads metadata from your models to generate a quick, model‑centric dashboard.
- Lets trusted users (e.g., site administrators) perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations without writing extra code.
- Intended primarily as an internal management tool for site content and users, not a full end‑user front end.

### Key Features of Django Admin
- Model Management: View, add, edit, delete model instances with search, filters, pagination.
- User and Permission Management: Manage users, groups, and permissions to control access.
- Customizable Interface: Tailor display/behavior via `ModelAdmin` classes.
- Security: Built‑in authentication and CSRF protection.
- Integration: Works with Django’s ORM and forms to reflect your data models directly.
- Extensibility: Add custom views, actions, filters, and templates.
