What is a Django model? Include basics, a quick example, and the resulting SQL table.

---

- A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data.
- It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data youâ€™re storing.
- Generally, each model maps to a single database table.

Basics:
- Each model is a Python class that subclasses `django.db.models.Model`.
- Each attribute of the model represents a database field.
- Django provides an automatically-generated database-access API (see Making queries).

Quick example:
```python
from django.db import models


class Person(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
```
- `first_name` and `last_name` are fields of the model. Each field is a class attribute that maps to a database column.

Resulting SQL table (example):
```sql
CREATE TABLE myapp_person (
    "id" bigint NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    "first_name" varchar(30) NOT NULL,
    "last_name" varchar(30) NOT NULL
);
```

Technical notes:
- Table name `myapp_person` is derived from model metadata but can be overridden.
- An implicit `id` primary key is added automatically; you can override this behavior.
- SQL is tailored to your configured database backend; the example shows PostgreSQL-style SQL.
