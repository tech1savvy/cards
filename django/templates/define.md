What are Django templates and what is their purpose?

---

Django templates are HTML files with embedded Django template language that allow you to create dynamic web pages by combining HTML structure with data from your views.

---

Templates serve as the presentation layer in Django's MVT architecture:

- **Separation of concerns**: Keep HTML separate from Python logic
- **Reusability**: Create base templates that can be extended
- **Dynamic content**: Display data from views using template variables
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update HTML without touching Python code

Template files typically have `.html` extension.
