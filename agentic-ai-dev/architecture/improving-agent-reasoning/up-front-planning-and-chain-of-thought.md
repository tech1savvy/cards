# Up-Front-Planning (Ahead of Time Planning)

---

### What is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting?

- > CoT prompting encourages LLMs to _break down complex problems into smaller, sequential reasoning steps before answering_ rather than jumping directly to an answer.
- It mirrors human problem-solving by explicitly guiding the model to think step-by-step through the problem.

### Why CoT Improves Performance

- **Decomposition of Complexity:** By dividing a task into smaller parts, the model handles each step with better focus and accuracy.
- **Better Reasoning:** LLMs trained on many multi-step reasoning examples learn the next logical step after a correct current step, improving consistency.
- **Interpretable Output:** Provides transparency into the model’s reasoning, making it easier to debug and trust the results.
- **Applicability Across Domains:** Useful for arithmetic, commonsense reasoning, multi-hop question answering, and complex workflows.

### How to Use CoT

- Ask the model explicitly to “think step-by-step” or “show your reasoning.”
- Provide examples showing detailed problem-solving processes (few-shot prompting).
- Use CoT as part of initial planning before executing steps, improving downstream task execution.

### Benefits in Agent Design

- _Enables upfront planning_ and decomposition of tasks, supporting better adaptation and error handling.
- Can generate executable plans or pseudo-code for downstream processing.
- Allows splitting reasoning (high-quality, slow model) from execution (faster, simpler model following plan).
- Improves robustness for brittle or rigid systems needing well-defined input/output formats.
