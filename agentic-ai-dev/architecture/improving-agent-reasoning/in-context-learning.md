# In-Context Learning

> example-based learning

### Teaching AI Like Interns via Examples

- Instead of explicit step-by-step instructions, AI can learn by **seeing examples of problems being solved correctly** â€” similar to how humans teach interns by demonstration.
- Few-shot or in-context learning where examples of problem, reasoning, tool choice, and outcomes are shown helps AI understand tasks implicitly.

### Pattern Learning and Completion

- Large language models are trained to **predict the next word or complete patterns**, so _presenting them with partial examples encourages them to continue in a similar style_ or logical sequence.
- This induces the model to follow structured problem-solving patterns involving thought decomposition, tool selection, and result generation.
