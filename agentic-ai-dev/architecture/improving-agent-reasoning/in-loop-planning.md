# In-Loop-Planning (Intermediate Planning)

---

### Ahead-of-Time Planning Limitations

- Creating a complete plan before execution helps structure the agent's work.
- However, the _plan placed early in memory may fall out of focus due to new inputs appended later_, especially in long-running loops.
- The agent may lose track of the plan, repeat steps, or go off course.

### Importance of Plan Reinforcement

- Regularly reminding the agent of the plan and progress helps maintain consistency and alignment.
- Generating intermediate "progress reports" that summarize completed steps and highlight next steps fosters coherent execution.
- This reflective prompting can be done every loop, periodically (e.g., every 3rd iteration), or when needed based on experimentation.

### Approaches to Using Plans in Agent Loops

- **Static Execution**: Generate a plan, translate it into executable code or workflow, then run it all at once outside the agent loop.
- **Memory Embedding**: Insert the plan as part of the agent's memory at start, allowing dynamic step-wise execution within the loop.
- **Plan Update Cycles**: Incorporate updated summaries/reflections of plan state after every few steps to realign agent decisions.

### Challenges & Tradeoffs

- Complex or long plans may be hard for the LLM to track, especially if prone to branching or failed paths.
- Periodic plan updates improve attention to current goals but add overhead and complexity.

### Practical Recommendations

- Determine max reliable plan length by testing before plan drift occurs.
- Implement periodic or conditional plan reflection to keep plans top of mind.
- Use structured summaries of completed work and planned next steps to guide agent iterations.

### Summary

Maintaining awareness of step-wise plans throughout the agent loop is essential to address drift and inconsistency in long-running tasks. Periodic reinforcement of plan state and progress is a practical method to support sustained, coherent agent behavior in sequential workflows.
