# Prompts as Computational Operations

---

- Prompts are not just chat tricks but fundamental computational building blocks or "operations" that a new generative AI CPU performs.
- They can be designed as reusable, powerful tools or functions for agents, encapsulating complex logic in natural language.

### Examples Illustrating Prompt Power

- Generating realistic synthetic data like a random list of plausible file names from a prompt is a kind of computation difficult to achieve with traditional code.
- Organizing files into directory hierarchies based on file types or more abstract semantics (work vs personal) by a prompt shows flexible, semantic reasoning beyond fixed rule coding.
- These prompt-based computations dynamically adapt to new cases (e.g., new file types like SVG) without requiring explicit reprogramming.

### Prompts Empower Agents

- Agents gain incredible capabilities by including prompt-based tools that leverage the pretrained knowledge and reasoning of generative AI models.
- This creates maintainable, extensible systems that separate domain knowledge (e.g., policies, rules) into prompts applied as computations, rather than hardcoded logic.

### Example of Turning Policies into Computation

- Feeding a document like Vanderbiltâ€™s travel policy into the AI as a prompt lets the agent apply that policy to real-world data (like an expense receipt) dynamically and accurately.
- Changes to the policy simply become updates to the prompt, decoupling policy logic from code.

### Overall Shift

- Prompts represent a new paradigm in programming where natural language describes computations, leveraging vast pretrained knowledge and reasoning ability of generative AI.
- This transforms software and agent design toward more declarative, flexible, and powerful computational frameworks.

This perspective invites thinking of prompt engineering as programming a new kind of AI processor, crucial for building next-generation intelligent agents.
