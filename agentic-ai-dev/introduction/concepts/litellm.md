- `litellm` is a python open-source library and proxy server that provides a unified interface to call over 100 Large Language Model (LLM) APIs such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Huggingface, VertexAI, and more. It uses the OpenAI input/output format to standardize calls to various LLM providers' endpoints including completion, embedding, and image generation.
