- Agentic AI uses a "**flipped interaction**" pattern where the _AI_ goes and _asks questions or tells what to do_, instead of just answering user questions.
- It operates by asking questions or giving instructions one at a time to gather information and specify actions step-by-step to accomplish a goal.
- The AI adapts dynamically to the user's input, changing its next question or step based on what it learns from previous responses.
- This _stepwise, adaptive interaction_ is powerful because it lets the _AI_ act as if it's "_in the driver's seat_" directing a process.
- The AI handles free-flowing, unstructured responses fluidly without requiring rigid input formats.
- This pattern applies both to gathering information from humans and interacting with computer systems or databases, though the latter requires communication in specific system languages.
- Large language models excel at translating between natural human language and structured languages needed to interact with databases or systems.
- Agentic AIâ€™s role is akin to a protocol interface or translator that can communicate flexibly with humans and rigid computer systems seamlessly.
- Unlike traditional AI interactions, agentic AI autonomously determines and adapts the sequence of steps to achieve a goal, receiving feedback after each action to adjust its plan continuously.
- This approach enables practical problem solving by autonomously generating and sequencing necessary tasks while collaborating with humans or systems to execute and report results.

These points highlight the core prompt pattern and interaction style that enable generative AI to function as an adaptive, task-driven agent rather than just a question-answer system.
