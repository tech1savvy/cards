- Agentic AI is AI with _agency_, meaning it can autonomously act, problem-solve, and react to different situations rather than just passively generate information.
- It operates by specifying actions to be done, observing results, and adapting subsequent actions based on feedback.
- Agentic AI can be partially automated with a _human in the loop_ who performs or carries out the AI’s specified actions and provides outcome feedback.
- It exemplifies collaboration between generative AI and humans, where the AI guides tasks step-by-step, and the human executes and reports back.
- Agentic AI dynamically alters plans and instructions based on changing conditions or unexpected inputs (e.g., handling burning meat or substituting ingredients).
- The system focuses on continuous interaction: issuing tasks, receiving results, and deciding next steps.
- This type of AI contrasts with traditional rigid systems by being flexible and adaptive rather than fixed and brittle.
- Agentic AI must bridge the gap between its intuitive, narrative way of specifying tasks and the strict, exact inputs required by existing computer systems.
- Humans as executors are more tolerant of AI’s natural language explanations and variations, whereas rigid software systems require precise, formal instructions.
- The development of agentic systems involves prompt engineering to align AI’s communicative style with the demands of real-world software or human collaborators.

These concepts together form the core understanding of Agentic AI as an autonomous, adaptive system designed for interactive task execution with flexibility and human or system collaboration.
