> Key concepts about the new ways of accessing and extracting information using generative AI is transforming data and data usage are:

### New Flexibility in Data Handling

- Traditional computing relies on highly structured, formatted data for processing—lots of effort is spent curating and standardizing data.
- Generative AI breaks this rigidity by accepting and extracting usable information from unstructured or semi-structured inputs like images, free text, or even mixed data formats.
- This flexibility reduces the need for exhaustive pre-processing or database creation.

### Examples of Data as Flexible Input

- > A photo of a catering menu can be directly used to generate a lunch order without manual data entry or converting menus into databases.
- A photo of a coffee maker can be queried directly for operational instructions, replacing traditional manual lookup in user manuals or databases.

### New Paradigm for Data Querying and Access

- Data access shifts from querying curated databases to on-demand, contextually aware querying of rich, raw inputs (images, text, real-world scenes).
- This enables querying information “in the moment” and “in the place” it is needed, enhancing usability and immediacy.

### Analogies and Implications

- This is similar to sci-fi scenarios where knowledge is downloaded on demand (e.g., helicopter flying instructions in The Matrix), but now achievable via simple photos and natural language queries.
- This shift disrupts conventional data management approaches, calling for new strategies to leverage generative AI’s strengths in flexible, multimodal data comprehension.

### Transformative Potential

- Enables solving new problem classes that were impractical before due to data structuring overhead.
- Democratizes data access and usage by allowing humans to interact naturally and effectively with complex information sources without engineering conventional pipelines.

This represents a fundamental rethinking of data definition, management, and interaction unleashed by generative AI’s capabilities.
