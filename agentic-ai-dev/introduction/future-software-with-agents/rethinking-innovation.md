The key concepts from this description about the future of software building with generative AI are:

### Traditional vs Future Software Development

- Traditional software development is slow, costly, and often produces solutions that don’t fully meet user needs after long iterations with developers or generic licensed solutions.
- The future is more user-driven, where people—often non-developers—build custom applications quickly by leveraging generative AI.

### Example 1: Policy Auditing Software

- Uploading complex policy documents (like Vanderbilt’s travel expense policy) and applying those policies to real-world inputs (e.g., receipts) can produce instant compliance auditing that would otherwise take a team years to build.
- This reduces development effort dramatically by treating documents and rules as inputs to AI agents that understand and apply them automatically.

### Example 2: Vision-Based Inventory Management

- By giving simple prompts plus photos, even a non-developer (e.g., a child) can build a sophisticated inventory system that recognizes objects, tracks conditions, and estimates prices—something that conventional software teams would struggle to build quickly or cheaply.
- Generative AI empowers broader audiences to create complex, powerful applications with minimal effort.

### Transformative Impact

- Generative AI is transforming who can build software—empowering end users instead of relying solely on professional developers.
- This shift requires retraining people to think about problem-solving with AI and building software in new, direct ways.

### Takeaway

- The future of building applications is interactive, rapid, and accessible, with AI agents understanding input documents, images, and prompts to deliver working solutions almost immediately.
- This democratizes software creation and opens new possibilities for innovation and productivity.
