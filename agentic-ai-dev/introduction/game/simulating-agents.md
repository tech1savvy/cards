# Rapidly Prototyping Agents by Simulating them in Conversation

---

### Rapid Iteration Through Simulation

- The core challenge in building agents lies not in the code but in defining the right **design of instructions, tools, and data formats**.
- Rapid iteration is enabled by simulating the agent's behavior in a conversation with a tool such as ChatGPT, closely mimicking the agent loop.
- The human acts as the **environment**, manually executing actions and providing simulated results, speeding up design feedback without coding.

### Simulating the Agent Loop

- The micro-agent receives goals (e.g., “document all code”), a defined set of actions (e.g., list files, read file, write file) and then outputs the next action.
- The conversation history acts as memory for the agent to keep track of prior actions/results.
- By manually injecting results or errors, design flaws or ambiguities can be surfaced early.

### Discovering and Fixing Design Issues

- Example: Not providing a starting path to file actions revealed a design gap that led to adding a new tool "GetProjectDirectory."
- Feedback from simulation helps refine goals, the set of tools/actions available, and how outputs are structured.
- Ambiguities in goals (e.g., how to document files without overwriting) can be clarified either by changing goals or making tools more specific.

### Advantages of Conversational Prototyping

- Fast, cheap experiments before implementation reduce wasted development time.
- Enables testing of tool naming, action structure, and memory design interactively.
- Allows stress-testing conversation length and complexity to see if agent reasoning holds up.
- Provides full control over inputs and faults to improve agent robustness.

### Summary of Key Components in This Process

- **Goals:** What the agent should achieve, refined iteratively.
- **Actions:** Tools the agent can use; can be added or modified quickly in the prompt.
- **Memory:** The conversation history that the agent references.
- **Environment:** The human playing the role of execution environment, simulating real-world interaction.

This simulated conversational approach forms a low-cost, iterative design method providing rapid feedback to improve the agent’s instructions, tools, and behavior before any actual code is written.
