### Using Patterns as examples

- Training them patterns help agents handle ambiguity.

### Programming via **Future Instructions**

- Instead of instructing AI on what to do after the fact, you can program its behavior _up front using directives_ like “ _From now on, respond with a super excited tone_ ”
- This approach shapes the AI’s behavior across all future interactions in the conversation, not just a single response.

### Importance of Contextualizing AI with **Background Knowledge**

- _Providing_ AI with specific, personalized _background information_ (_e.g., name, role, location_) enables more relevant, tailored responses.
