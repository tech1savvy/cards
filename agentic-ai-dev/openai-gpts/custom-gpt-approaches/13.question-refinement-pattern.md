### **Question refinement pattern**, which helps reduce ambiguity by improving user questions before answering.

**Ambiguous User Questions**: Users often ask vague or unclear questions (e.g., “Can I get reimbursed for gas?”), which can be misinterpreted.
**Question Refinement Pattern**: The GPT automatically rephrases or refines the user’s input into a clearer, more specific version.

- **Suggest + Confirm Workflow**: After refining, the GPT presents the improved question to the user and asks if they’d like it answered instead.
- **Reduced Risk of Misinterpretation**: By clarifying before answering, the GPT avoids giving factually wrong or misleading responses.
- **User Feedback Loop**: If the refinement is wrong, the user corrects it, giving the GPT crucial insight into their true intent.
- **Automatic Disambiguation**: Converts vague prompts into domain-specific, contextually scoped questions (e.g., clarifying “fuel expenses while traveling on Vanderbilt business”).
- **Safer Interaction**: Prevents GPT from answering based on incorrect assumptions.
- **Information Augmentation**: The refinement process adds clarity and detail, creating higher-quality input for the GPT to work with.
- **Applicability**: Works not just for questions but also for tasks or instructions, making them more precise before the GPT acts.
- **Collaborative Process**: Encourages the user and GPT to co-develop the right question, fostering accuracy and engagement.
