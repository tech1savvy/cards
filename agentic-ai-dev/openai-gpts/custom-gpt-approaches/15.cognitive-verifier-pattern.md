### **Cognitive Verifier Pattern**: Decomposing the problem

- > a method for improving reasoning in custom GPTs by breaking down complex or ambiguous queries into sub-questions.

---

**Complex Questions Need Decomposition**: Many user queries (e.g., “reasonable and appropriate expenses”) involve multiple dimensions that can’t be answered in one step.
**Cognitive Verifier Pattern**: A prompt design where the GPT breaks the user’s question into smaller 3–4 _sub-questions_ that clarify and structure the reasoning process.

---

**Sub-Question Strategy**: Rather than jumping to an answer, GPT proposes specific related sub-questions (e.g., reimbursable airfare classes, restrictions for upgrades, definitions of “reasonable”).
**Improved Accuracy and Reasoning**: Tackling smaller, well-scoped questions leads to more reliable and thoughtful answers.
**User Collaboration**: The GPT shows the sub-questions first, asks if the user wants to proceed, and then answers them, combining results into a final conclusion.
**Transparency of Reasoning**: Decomposing the problem makes the reasoning steps visible to the user, building trust and shared understanding.
**Ambiguity Management**: Breaking down helps expose gray areas in policy interpretation that might not be obvious initially.
**Final Answer as a Synthesis**: The GPT combines the outputs from sub-questions into one coherent final response, grounded in step-by-step logic.
**Better Engagement**: Involving the user in confirming the sub-questions ensures alignment and prevents misinterpretation early in the exchange.
**General Principle**: Models reason more effectively when problems are chunked into smaller, simpler parts—mirroring human critical thinking best practices.
