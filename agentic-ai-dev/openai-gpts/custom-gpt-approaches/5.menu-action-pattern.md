- **Menu Actions Pattern**: Pre-baked commands that users can invoke (e.g., `/email`, `/options`), acting like shortcuts or menu buttons inside a text-based system.

- **Beyond Conversation Starters**: Unlike one-time starter prompts, menu actions are available _anytime_ during the conversation, making GPTs more powerful and flexible.
- **Command Syntax**: Actions can be triggered with chosen markers (slashes `/`, hashtags `#`, stars `*`, etc.), keeping commands distinct and easy to type.
- **Predefined Workflows**: Each command triggers a specific, useful behavior, such as drafting an email, listing allowed options, or retrieving policy quotations.
- **Efficiency Boost**: Reduces the cognitive load on users by replacing long, complex prompts with simple commands.
- **Discoverability**: The GPT can suggest or list available menu commands, so the user knows what actions they can take without guessing.
- **Context Retention**: Commands can build on the current conversation (e.g., `/preapprove` creates an email about the travel expense just discussed).
- **Action Variability**: Commands can be informational (e.g., list rules), operational (draft email), or exploratory (list options).
- **Scalability**: Commands can be expanded into structured hierarchies of menus, enabling more complex yet still user-friendly GPT interactions.
- **Internal Use Cases**: Particularly useful in enterprise or operational settings where speed, accuracy, and reducing friction are more valuable than free-form creativity.
