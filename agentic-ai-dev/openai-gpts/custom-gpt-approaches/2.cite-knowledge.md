# How to minimize errors and increase trust when answering user questions based on a knowledge base.

- **Direct Quotations**: The most reliable way to support an answer is by _pulling exact text_ (inside quotation marks) directly from the source document.
- **Traceability**: _Providing page numbers_, sections, or identifiers with quotations allows users to fact-check easily.
- **User Autonomy**: give the _original language instead of over-explaining_ or misinterpretation, so the _user can think through the meaning for themselves_.
- **Consistency Checking**: Users (and you) can verify the accuracy later by searching the document for the exact phrasing.
- **Transparency**: Showing the actual source text builds trust since the user can compare your output against the policy.
- **Neutrality**: Providing quotations without discussion prevents influencing the userâ€™s interpretation of the policy.
- **Fact-Based Reasoning**: Answers should be grounded in verifiable facts that humans can trace back, not just model-generated summaries.
