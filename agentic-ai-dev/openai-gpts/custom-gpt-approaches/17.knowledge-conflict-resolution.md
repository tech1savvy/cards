### **Conflict Resolution Strategies**

> for custom GPTs when multiple documents or policies may overlap, conflict, or change over time.

### Key Concepts

- In Strategy 1 (**Layered Approach**), _older policies remain partially valid if newer ones donâ€™t explicitly override them_. This makes the latest policy an incremental update that builds upon past rules.

- In Strategy 2 (**Strict Supersession**), the _newest policy is considered self-contained. Anything not included is assumed intentionally removed_, so older rules vanish once a new policy is issued.
