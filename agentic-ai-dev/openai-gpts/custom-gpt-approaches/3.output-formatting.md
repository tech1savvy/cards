# Template Pattern

- > **Template Pattern**: A structured method to _guide GPT outputs responses by predefining the format with placeholders_.

---

- **Controlled Output**: Instead of leaving responses free-form, you constrain answers to specific formats, such as "Yes | No | Maybe."
- **Markdown for Structure**: Leverage Markdown headings (#, ##) and formatting to create clear sections (e.g., Answer, Supporting Information, Discussion).
- **Placeholders**: Use markers like `<answer>` or `<quotations>` to tell the model exactly what should be inserted and how.
- **Constraints**: Narrow the GPT’s output with explicit instructions such as limiting answers to a single word or enforcing quotation marks around cited text.
- **Multi-level Placeholders**: Placeholders don’t need to be simple; they can direct the model to perform complex tasks (e.g., “Discuss how quotations support your answer”).
- **Quotations Handling**: Use cues like quotes `"..."` and ellipses `...` to ensure the model outputs multiple direct quotations, not just one.
- **Consistency**: A template ensures every response follows the same predictable layout, making it easier for users to read and compare answers.
- **Improved User Experience**: By thinking intentionally about presentation, the custom GPT can deliver outputs that are cleaner, more relevant, and easier for users to interpret.
