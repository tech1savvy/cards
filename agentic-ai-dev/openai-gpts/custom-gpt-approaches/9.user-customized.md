### **Customization and feature toggling** in custom GPTs, using the **flipped interaction pattern** to gather user preferences before answering.

**Customizable Features**: Custom GPTs can be designed with optional features (e.g., FAQ generation) that can be turned on or off by users.
**Flipped Interaction for Preferences**: Begin by _asking the user whether they’d like to enable or disable specific features_ before answering their main question.
**User Control**: Empower users to personalize their interaction by deciding which features are active, making the GPT more flexible and user-focused.

- **Contextual Feature Use**: Not all users need or want every feature enabled, so customization prevents unnecessary clutter or irrelevant outputs.
- **Feature Example (FAQ)**: Automatically generating FAQ entries after questions, which can be enabled for support staff to build knowledge bases, or disabled if irrelevant.
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: The GPT can adapt its behavior mid-conversation by asking users about features “just in time.”
- **Expandability**: Beyond FAQs, the same pattern can enable features like trivia generation, role-aligned quizzes, or content styled to personal interests.
- **Explicit Preference Gathering**: Always collect user feature preferences before attempting to answer, ensuring outputs match expectations.
- **Personalization for Engagement**: By tailoring both content and capabilities to user needs, GPTs feel more relevant, efficient, and cooperative.
- **Consistency Across Use Cases**: This pattern (feature enable/disable) applies broadly—from enterprise tools to education, research, and creative experiences.
