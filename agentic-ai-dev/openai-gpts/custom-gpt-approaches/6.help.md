**Human-in-the-Loop**: Users often need or prefer to consult a person; _GPT should facilitate reaching the right human expert_.

**Escape Valve**: Always provide a way out of the GPT interaction by suggesting a contact, resource, or support channel.
**Contact Information**: End answers with relevant people or resources (email, phone, ticketing system, FAQ, web pages) the user can reach out to.
**Intelligent Routing**: Direct users to the _appropriate_ contact or system depending on the nature of the question (e.g., finance vs. registration).
**Context-Dependent Referrals**: The GPT can decide which resource is most relevant based on the user’s query.
**Resource Awareness**: External information sources like FAQs, documents, or websites can supplement AI responses.
**Reduced AI Dependency**: The GPT doesn’t need to fully solve the problem itself—it acts as a bridge between the user and existing support resources.
**User-Centric Support**: Recognizes that many users start with GPT because it’s accessible, but may prefer or require escalation to human or official resources.
**Consistency**: Embedding the contact/referral step in every reply ensures users always know their next step if AI guidance isn’t enough.
