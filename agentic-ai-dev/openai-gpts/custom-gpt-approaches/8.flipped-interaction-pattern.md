**Flipped Interaction Pattern**: Instead of the user providing all information up front, the GPT asks _guiding questions_ to gather what it needs.

---

**Question-Led Approach**: The system elicits context by prompting the user with questions, making the interaction adaptive and dynamic.
**Useful for Non-Experts**: Especially helpful when users lack domain knowledge or don’t know what details are relevant.
**Goal-Oriented Dialogue**: The GPT keeps asking questions _until it decides_ it has enough information to achieve a defined goal (e.g., generate a recipe).
**Incremental Questioning**: Questions can be asked one at a time (or in batches), preventing overwhelming the user.
**Trigger Phrasing**: Prompts like “ask me the first question” can help start the process smoothly.
**Adaptive Termination**: The GPT determines when it has sufficient input to act instead of relying on the user to know when to stop.
**User Override Option**: At any point, the user can tell it to “fill in the blanks” and proceed, letting GPT assume defaults or make choices.
**Collaborative Information Building**: Shifts responsibility—the GPT structures the exploration, while the human fills in responses, creating a more cooperative experience.
**Broad Applicability**: Can improve problem-solving, contextual reasoning, creativity (e.g., recipes, designs), and business use-cases requiring deep situational detail.
