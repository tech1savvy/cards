### **Alternative Approaches Pattern**

- _Instead of_ forcing a _single uncertain answer_, GPT identifies ambiguity and _provides alternatives with clearly allowable solutions_.

---

**Ambiguity in Answers**: Policies and user questions often lead to unclear or multi-interpretable answers.
**Risk of Wrong Answers**: Giving a confident but uncertain answer can mislead users, especially in sensitive areas like reimbursements.
**Legal and Trust Implications**: Organizations may be legally or reputationally liable if GPT gives incorrect guidance that causes harm.
**Explicit Instruction**: The system should first analyze if the question has a clear-cut policy answer; if not, switch to suggesting alternatives.
**Structured Response Format**:

- State clearly: “Answer unclear.”
- Restate the original request (e.g., “Instead of XYZ...”).
- Provide **3 alternative options** that are definitely compliant with policy.
  **User Problem-Solving Support**: Helps the user achieve their underlying goal (e.g., comfort, legroom) while staying within known rules.
  **Boundaries with Helpfulness**: Maintains strict compliance to policy guardrails but avoids leaving the user without options.
  **Confidence Signaling**: By explicitly labeling the answer as “unclear,” the GPT avoids overstating certainty.
  **Generalizable Strategy**: This pattern can apply across domains—compliance, HR, legal, finance—where ambiguity and high risk overlap.
