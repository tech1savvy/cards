| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Page reloads    | No page refresh after initial load | Full page reload on each navigation |
| User experience | Smooth, app-like                   | Traditional, page-by-page           |
| SEO             | More complex, requires extra work  | Easier, individual pages indexed    |
| Speed           | Faster after initial load          | Slower due to full reloads          |
| Use cases       | Highly interactive UI, dashboards  | Content-heavy, multi-section sites  |

### Single Page Application (SPA)

- A SPA loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content without reloading the entire page.
- Provides a smooth, app-like experience with fast transitions.
- Examples: Facebook, Twitter, Gmail.

### Multi-Page Application (MPA)

- A MPA loads a new HTML page from the server whenever the user navigates to a different part of the app.
- More traditional web structure, like most classic websites.
- Examples: E-commerce sites, news portals, blogs.
