What are the trade-offs of using a nested function vs. a separate helper function?

---

The choice depends on whether the helper function needs to be reused elsewhere.

- **Nested Function (using a closure):**
  - **Pro:** Good for encapsulation; keeps the helper private.
  - **Pro:** Can directly access parent variables without needing parameters.
  - **Con:** Not reusable outside of the parent function.

- **Separate Function:**
  - **Pro:** Easily reusable and testable across your application.
  - **Con:** Less encapsulated; exists in a wider scope.
  - **Con:** Requires all necessary data to be passed in as arguments.

For a small, single-use helper, nesting is often cleaner. For complex or reusable logic, a separate function is better. Modern JavaScript engines optimize both patterns well, so performance is not a major concern.
